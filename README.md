## What is CanvaTrans?

`CanvaTrans` is a decentralized content-sharing platform built on Arbitrum (a Layer 2 scaling solution) Blockchain. It empowers creators to truly own, manage, and monetize their digital content in ways never before possible. By the use blockchain technology, CanvaTrans creates a transparent, secure, and creator-centric ecosystem that changes how digital content is shared and monetized.

## The Problem We Solve

In today's digital landscape, creators face numerous challenges that hinder their ability to thrive, here are the the problems:

1. **Limited Ownership and Control**: Traditional platforms often claim rights to user-generated content, leaving creators with little control over their work.
   - Example: Facebook's terms of service grant the platform "a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license" to user content [Facebook Terms](https://web.facebook.com/legal/terms#:~:text=Section%201%20above.-,Specifically,-%2C%20when%20you%20share).

2. **Inadequate Revenue**: Many creators struggle to earn a living wage from their content.
   - Statistic: A 2021 study by `Linktree` found that only 12% of content creators earn more than $50,000 annually from their work. Simply because most web2 platform pays content creator less than 70% of their earning.

3. **Lack of Transparency**: Monetization processes on existing platforms are often opaque, leaving creators in the dark about their earnings.
   - Example: YouTube's demonetization policies have been criticized for their lack of clarity, with creators often unaware of why their content is demonetized. Imagine waking up one day and finiding out you source of income is gone for reasons you do not understand.
   
4. **Dependence on Intermediaries**: Creators rely on platform algorithms and policies for audience reach and payments.
   - Statistic: Instagram's algorithm changes in 2021 led to a 44% decrease in engagement rates for creators, according to a study by Later and Fohr.

5. **Data Privacy Concerns**: Creators and users alike are increasingly worried about how their data is used on centralized platforms.
   - Fact: In 2022, Meta (Facebook) was fined €390 million for GDPR violations related to data processing.

`CanvaTrans` addresses these pain points head-on, offering a solution that puts creators first and gives users control over their data.
